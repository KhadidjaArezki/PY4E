00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:01.180
Everybody, this is Chuck.

2
00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:03.240
I'm here in Hawaii at
the Lava Lava Beach Club.

3
00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.220
I've spent a week here,
I gave a keynote speech but

4
00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:09.990
I spent more of my time working on
the assignments for course number three.

5
00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:11.550
Welcome to course number three.

6
00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.530
You'll see that the assignments in course
number three are a little bit different

7
00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:17.710
than all the rest of the assignments
in course number one and number two.

8
00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:20.730
We want you to really
treat them as a puzzle.

9
00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.340
Don't try to just finish them.

10
00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:26.690
We give you a very unfinished code,
or code that's barely related and

11
00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:31.300
we want you to construct them, because
that's, the real skill of programming is

12
00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.990
to be able to face a problem, a puzzle and
puzzle your way through upon thinking it.

13
00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:39.120
So don't feel like you gotta like
slap this and just get her done.

14
00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.730
The process is more
important than the results.

15
00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.270
So again welcome to course number three.
